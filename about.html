                    <h6>“You are like a light for the whole world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.<br>
                    No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl; instead, they put it on the lampstand,<br>
                    where it gives light for everyone in the house. In the same way your light must shine before
                    people,<br>
                    so that they will see the good things you do and praise your Father in heaven.”<br><br>
                    -Matthew 5:14-16</p></h6>
